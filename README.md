GifTastic Movie App

This is an app that I created that pulls movie poster images from OMDB and creates buttons for a list of items in an array.  You can also add new movie posters but it will check to make sure the movie exsists first.  Once you add a movie it will re-render all of the user buttons.   Clicking on any of the posters will spit out 10 related GIF's in a still state.  If a user clicks on any of the GIF's it will startto play the annimation.  

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.
