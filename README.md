GifTastic Movie App

This is an app that I created that pulls movie poster images from OMDB and creates buttons for a list of items in an array.  You can also add new movie posters but it will check to make sure the movie exsists first.  Once you add a movie it will re-render all of the user buttons.   Clicking on any of the posters will spit out 10 related GIF's in a still state.  If a user clicks on any of the GIF's it will startto play the annimation.  

Usage:
1. Click on one of the pre-populated movies to viw GIF's
2. Type a movie name into the text box to add a new movie poster
3. Click on the movie poster that was just added to vieew GIF's movies to viw GIF's
